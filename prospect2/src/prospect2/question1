For Task 1, I’d create an API endpoint that takes a category parameter, uses GET to retrieve 
products from the specified category, then filters and formats the product data to return only
the required details (title, price, description, etc.).

For Task 2, I’d implement an API endpoint to accept product data in a POST request, 
ensuring all relevant fields are validated, and then send this data to the external API for 
creation.
